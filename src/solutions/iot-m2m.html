            <p class="font-semibold">Reduce overhead, simplify deployment, and centralize management.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">One of the biggest challenges in managing large-scale IoT deployments is the sheer diversity of vendors and data plans. Our platform provides a single pane of glass with a comprehensive view of your entire IoT environment. We provide the tools and functions you need to manage all your data plans, vendors, and devices in one place. This enables centralized provisioning and connectivity management, while providing the insights you need to continuously optimize your deployment, monitor usage, and keep control over costs.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-2 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl">Diversify</h3>
            <p class="font-semibold">Break free from restrictive single-carrier strategies that hinder innovation.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">Getting the coverage you need usually means working with multiple vendors and contracts. It is never long before this becomes a major burden on management and a barrier to innovation. Many businesses need to be able to support multiple connectivity types, carriers, and vendors, which is why we support the broadest range possible. We offer the full suite of cellular options, including 3G and 4G LTE, including low-power technologies like NB-IoT and Cat-M. We also offer support for multiple data plan types and sizes and satellite connectivity plans.</p>

            <p class="font-semibold"> Keep ahead of network issues and mitigate unscheduled downtime </p>
            <p class="mt-4">With a highly complex and diversified IoT environment, there is an inherent danger of a small, localized problem resulting in far-reaching consequences. We mitigate the chances of that happening with intelligent management tools that let you maintain full visibility into and control over your environment. Automated threshold alerts from sensors and other IoT devices give you the chance to proactively address network issues and ensure optimal performance for every device on your network.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-8 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl">Scale</h3>
            <p class="font-semibold"> Achieve rapid innovation and scale seamlessly with demand </p>
            <p class="mt-4">No two IoT environments look the same, which is why it is vital that businesses have a scalable and flexible solution for deploying and managing their IoT applications. That’s why we support the broadest range of networking devices, such as routers and gateways, and endpoints, such as tablets and embedded systems. With centralized mobile device management (MDM), you can provision new devices and data plans in less time and manage them seamlessly from our centralized web-based platform.</p>
